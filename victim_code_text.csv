"59","Who is a ‘victim’ under this Code?",34
"60","This Code acknowledges that the terms ‘complainant’ and ‘survivor’ are often used in the criminal justice system to describe a person who has made a criminal allegation to the police. However, for the purpose of this Code, the definition of a ‘victim’ is:",255

"67","Which Rights will apply to you?",31
"68","Which Rights apply to you will depend on whether the crime is reported to the police, if the case goes to court, and whether the defendant is convicted, as well as your personal needs and circumstances. Rights 1, 4 and 12 apply to all victims. The remaining Rights only apply where a crime has been reported to the police. The relevant service provider will tell you which Rights apply to you.",393

"74","If you have suffered harm, including physical, mental or emotional harm or economic loss, as a direct result of witnessing a crime, you are a victim of crime for the purposes of this Code and are able to access services that support victims. You do not need to have provided a statement to or been interviewed by the police, or be required to attend court as a witness.",369
"75","All other witnesses can access services provided under the Witness Charter [footnote 6] rather than under this Code.",116
"76","You have the Right to services under this Code regardless of your resident status. However, if the crime was committed in England or Wales but you live elsewhere, you should access support services where you live. If you are required to give evidence in court in England or Wales, you will be able to access support services while you are in England or Wales.",359
"77","Families bereaved[footnote 7] by murder or manslaughter abroad",62

"80","How can I ensure I receive the best service?",44
"81","Service providers will try to minimise the number of different people you have contact with during your case, and wherever possible, offer you a single point of contact for information. To assist them in delivering your Rights under this Code, you should:",255

"87","You can choose to opt back in to receiving Rights under this Code at any time while the case is under active investigation, or prosecution, or the offender is serving their sentence. This does not apply to the Right to access support to help you to cope, and as far as possible, recover from being a victim of crime.",316

"92","If you receive unwanted contact from an offender who is on licence in the community, you can contact the police or if you have one, your Victim Liaison Officer. If the offender is under 18, you can also report any unwanted contact to the police, but if you know they are being supervised by a Youth Offending Team, you may wish to contact the team directly. Contact details for Youth Offending Teams are available at: www.gov.uk/government/collections/youth-offending-team-contact-details",488
"93","Information provided under this Code",36
"94","Service providers must include information about this Code on their websites. This information must also signpost victims to the relevant pages on: GOV.UK",154
"95","Where required to share information under this Code, service providers must do so effectively and in accordance with their obligations under the Data Protection Act and General Data Protection Regulation 2018 and other relevant legislation.",240
"96","Where there is a high number of victims involved in a case, such as large-scale investment frauds with multiple investor victims, or in other exceptional cases, the service provider may communicate information[footnote 10] that a victim has the Right to under this Code through alternative channels, such as their website, rather than contacting each victim individually.",371
"97","Nothing in this Code requires a service provider to provide information to the victim where its disclosure:",107
"98","• could result in harm to any person",36
"99","• could affect the proper handling of any criminal investigation or prosecution, or could otherwise prejudice any civil or criminal case, or parole proceedings, or",163
"100","• would, in the service provider’s view, be contrary to the interests of national security.",91
"101","What if I am contacted by the media?",36
"102","Generally, journalists can attend and report events that happen in court. Sometimes the media may take an interest in a case and approach you and/or your family for comment. There is no obligation to speak to them. However, you should be careful that you do not do anything to risk unfairly influencing the outcome of a court case and being in contempt of court[footnote 11]",374
"103","If you have any concerns or would like some advice, you can speak with the police or a victim support provider. Alternatively, you can contact the Independent Press Standards Organisation, who will talk to you about your concerns and give practical advice and guidance.",269
"104","If you have been the victim of crime and have a physical or mental health need as a result, you can access National Health Service services. You do not need to have reported a crime to the police in order to access these services.",230
"105","If someone is seriously ill or injured and their life is at risk, call the emergency services on: 999. If it is not a life-threatening emergency, there are several options you can take. You can:",194

"107","• go to your local National Health Service walk-in centre or local urgent care centre/minor injuries unit or your local Accident and Emergency (A&E) service department;",168
"108","• visit or call your General Practitioner, who can refer you to specialist services including mental health support; or",119
"109","More information about National Health Service services is available at www.nhs.uk or www.wales.nhs.uk, or by calling: 111/0845 46 47 in (England/ Wales) or by visiting your General Practitioner.",195
"110","As well as being referred by the police, you can also refer yourself to a Sexual Assault Referral Centre[footnote 12]. These centres have specially trained professionals who can give you both physical and mental health support if you have experienced rape or sexual assault, regardless of whether you choose to report the crime to the police or not.",349
"111","You can also access a wide range of psychological and emotional counselling and therapeutic approaches provided in a wide variety of settings, for instance, the National Health Service, voluntary sector agencies and private practice. If you are not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, you should note that some health services are exempt from payment, such as primary care services; services for the treatment of a physical or mental condition caused by torture, female genital mutilation, domestic violence, sexual violence or if you are determined a victim of modern slavery or human trafficking. Further details are available at: www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-entitlements-migrant-health-guide",697
"112","Coroners are not included as service providers under this Code. This is because inquests are not criminal proceedings and bereaved family members already have interested person status in inquests which gives them certain statutory Rights. This includes the Right to ask relevant questions of the witnesses and to receive disclosure of documents and other evidence. Bereaved family members of a victim of crime who are involved in an inquest should instead consult the guidance on coroners’ investigations for bereaved people which is available at: www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-coroner-services-andcoroner-investigations-a-short-guide",648
"113","Who is responsible for meeting the Rights under this Code?",58
"114","The following organisations are required to deliver the Rights under this Code:",79

"131","• Home Office (Immigration Enforcement)",39
"132","• The Information Commissioner’s Office",39
"133","• Independent Office for Police Conduct",39
"134","Other service providers can also have a role in relation to the investigation and/or prosecution of crimes.[footnote 14] However, unlike the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, who have a broad remit to investigate and prosecute crimes, these service providers are limited to investigating and prosecuting specific types of offences committed in certain circumstances. This will determine the way in which, and frequency with which, they come into contact with victims.",475
"135","The Rights in this Code only apply where other service providers (such as those listed above) accept formal responsibility for conducting a criminal investigation or making a decision to prosecute. However, not all functions undertaken by other service providers are identical to those carried out by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. Where functions are equivalent to a service provider under this Code (for example the other service provider is investigating or prosecuting an alleged offence), they must deliver the same Rights without unjustified delay, regardless of whether the other service provider is listed above.",635
"136","The role of Police and Crime Commissioners",42
"137","Police and Crime Commissioners are locally elected to secure efficient and effective policing. They have a legal duty to consult with victims in setting the policing priorities in their area and to hold the Chief Constable of the police in their area to account. They are responsible for commissioning many of the services that support victims outlined in this Code.",366
"138","The role of the Commissioner for Victims and Witnesses (Victims’ Commissioner)",78
"139","The Victims’ Commissioner is not listed as a service provider under this Code. This is because the Commissioner has a statutory duty to keep this Code under regular review. It is part of the Commissioner’s role to listen to the views of victims, understand the criminal justice system from the victims’ point of view and try to help improve the services and support available. The Victims’ Commissioner cannot help with individual cases or challenge criminal justice agencies to make different decisions.",504
"140","This Code acknowledges that victims who are considered vulnerable or intimidated, are a victim of the most serious crime (including a bereaved close relative) or have been persistently targeted are more likely to require specialised assistance (some victims may fall into one or more of these categories). Such support may include being offered a referral to a specialist support service, being contacted sooner after key decisions and having access to special measures (see Right 4) Within each individual Right this Code highlights where such Enhanced Rights apply.",567
"141","Once a service provider has identified that you are eligible for Enhanced Rights, they must ensure that this information is passed to other service providers with responsibilities under this Code and, where appropriate, to services that support victims.",253
"142","If you do not fall within the categories outlined above, a service provider may decide to provide access to certain Enhanced Rights depending on your circumstances or the impact of the crime.",191
"143","Vulnerable or intimidated victims",33
"144","You are eligible for Enhanced Rights under this Code as a vulnerable[footnote 15] victim if:",92
"145","• you are under 18 years of age at the time of the offence,[footnote 16] or",75
"146","• the quality of your evidence is likely to be affected because you",67
"147","• suffer from mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983",78
"148","• have a physical disability or are suffering from a physical disorder.",71
"149","You are also eligible for Enhanced Rights under this Code as an intimidated victim if the service provider considers that the quality of your evidence will be affected because of your fear of distress about testifying in court.[footnote 17]",240
"150","When assessing whether a victim is intimidated, the service provider must consider:",83
"151","• the behaviour towards the victim on the part of the suspect, members of their family or associates, or any other person who is likely to be a suspect or witness in the case",174
"152","• if relevant, the victim’s social and cultural background, religious beliefs or political opinions, ethnic origin, domestic and employment circumstances",153
"153","• the nature and alleged circumstance of the offence to which the case relates (victims of a sexual offence or human trafficking will be considered to be intimidated), and",171
"154","• any views expressed by the victim.",36
"155","Victims of the most serious crime",33
"156","You are eligible for Enhanced Rights under this Code as a victim of the most serious crime, if you are a close relative bereaved by a criminal offence, a victim of domestic abuse, hate crime, terrorism, sexual offences, human trafficking, modern slavery, attempted murder, kidnap, false imprisonment, arson with intent to endanger life and wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent.",393
"157","Additional Enhanced Rights that are available for bereaved close relatives are highlighted separately within each individual Right of this Code.",144
"158","You are eligible for Enhanced Rights under this Code as a persistently targeted victim if you have been targeted repeatedly as a direct victim of crime over a period of time, particularly if you have been deliberately targeted or if you are a victim of a campaign of harassment or stalking.",290
"159","Right 1: To be able to understand and to be understood",54
"160","1.1 You have the Right to be helped to understand what is happening and to be understood. In considering appropriate measures, service providers must consider any relevant personal characteristics which may affect your ability to understand and to be understood. All service providers must communicate in simple and accessible language and all translation or interpretation services must be offered free of charge to the victim.",428
"161","1.2 If, due to the impact of the crime, you need assistance to understand or to be understood, you can be supported by a person of your choice, unless the service provider considers that it would not be in your best interests or that it would impact the investigation or prosecution. In these circumstances, the service provider will tell you why.",347
"162","1.3 If you have difficulty understanding or speaking English, you have the Right to use an interpreter[footnote 18] to help you understand, when:",145
"163","• reporting a criminal offence[footnote 19]",43
"164","• being interviewed by the police",33
"165","1.4 You can also receive the translation of any document where it is essential for the purposes of the interview or court proceedings to read a document that is given to you, including:",185
"166","• the written acknowledgment of the reported crime",50
"167","• where it is essential for the purposes of the interview or court hearing to see a particular document that is disclosed to you, a copy of the relevant parts of the document",174
"168","• communication informing you of the date, time and location of the trial",73
"169","• the outcome of criminal proceedings and, where available, the reasons for the decision",88
"170","• the response to any complaint or request made under the Victims’ Right to Review Scheme.[footnote 20]",103
"171","1.5 You can also receive an oral translation or summary of any of the documents listed above, unless doing so would prejudice the fairness of the proceedings.",158
"172","1.6 For cases heard in Wales, you have the legal Right to use Welsh when giving evidence and the court will make the necessary arrangements.[footnote 22] You also have the Right to submit a Victim Personal Statement to the Parole Board in Welsh, irrespective of the location of the offender, and to ask for a summary of the parole decision to be provided in Welsh.",364
"173","Right 2: To have the details of the crime recorded without unjustified delay",76
"174","2.1 You have the Right to have details of the crime recorded by the police without unjustified delay after the incident. When you report an incident, you will be asked to provide details about the crime.",203
"175","2.2 If you are asked to make a witness statement, the police will explain to you that this may result in you needing to give evidence at court, if the case goes to trial.",170
"176","2.3 If you are asked to be interviewed, any interview should take place without unjustified delay, the number of interviews should be kept to a minimum and where possible be conducted by the same person. The police must take any steps necessary to ensure that you (and your family) do not have unnecessary contact with the suspect.",331
"177","2.4 The police must consider whether you would benefit from additional support, for example, the assistance of an interpreter, and that any interview is carried out by or through professionals trained for that purpose. They must also seek to ensure that it takes place in premises designed or adapted for the purpose. If this is not possible, the police will tell you why.",372
"178","2.5 You also have the Right to request to bring a person of your choice to the interview. If this is not possible, the police will tell you why.",144
"179","2.6 If the police or the Crown Prosecution Service believe that the quality of your evidence may be adversely affected by a vulnerability, they must consider whether you are eligible for support from a Registered Intermediary (see Right 4) and make any other reasonable adjustments based on your needs.",302
"180","What is a Registered Intermediary?",34
"181","A Registered Intermediary is a self-employed communication specialist who helps vulnerable victims and witnesses with communication difficulties to give evidence to the police and to the court in criminal trials.",212
"182","A victim/witness might need the help of a Registered Intermediary because of their age, a learning disability, a mental disorder or a physical disability that affects their ability to communicate. They are often the difference between a witness being able to give evidence or not.",280
"183","2.7 If a medical examination is required for the purposes of the criminal proceedings, these must be kept to a minimum and are subject to your consent.",151
"184","2.8 If you are a victim of sexual violence, gender-based violence or domestic abuse, you have the Right to request that the police officer conducting the interview is of a gender of your choice. The police must meet your request unless doing so would prejudice the fairness of the proceedings. If this happens, the police will tell you why.",340
"185","2.9 If you are considered vulnerable, for example under 18 years of age or intimidated (see Enhanced Rights), the police will ask you, or your parent/guardian, if you would like your police interview to be video recorded to make it easier for you to tell them what happened. This may be presented as your evidence in court. You may also be able to have your court cross examination evidence pre-recorded at a time earlier and separate to the trial. The police will discuss this option with you. If you do want to give your evidence at the trial, if eligible, a court may allow you to give your evidence and be cross-examined via a live-link room away from the court or a remote site, to minimise the risk of meeting the defendant. However, if you would prefer, you can give your evidence in court. Prosecutors should make witnesses aware that while they can consider how they might like to give evidence, it will be subject to an application to the court and the final decision is made by a judge.",997
"186","Right 3: To be provided with information when reporting the crime",65
"187","3.1 If you report a crime to the police or have an allegation reported on your behalf, or if you are contacted as a victim in the course of investigations, you have the Right to written confirmation of your allegation. This will include the basic details of the offence, a crime reference number and the contact details of the police officer dealing with your case. The confirmation could be a letter, email, text message, or it could be written by hand.",454
"188","3.2 Where the police consider there may be a risk of harm to you from sending the written confirmation, for example in domestic abuse cases, they must provide confirmation in a way that does not potentially risk your safety.",224
"189","3.3 The police will explain where you can get further information about the criminal justice process and your Rights as a victim. This will include information on where and how to get advice and support. For example, where appropriate and available, how to seek compensation (see Right 5) access to medical support, specialist support, such as psychological support (including pretrial therapy and counselling), and alternative accommodation. The police will also explain what arrangements are available if you do not live in England and Wales.",544
"190","If you are experiencing domestic abuse there are a number of organisations that can provide advice and support on how to access safe accommodation. The National Domestic Abuse Helpline is staffed 24 hours a day, every day of the year, by a dedicated team of experts and can be reached on: 0808 2000 247.

However, if you do not wish the offender to read your statement you may ask your Victim Liaison Officer to apply for the statement to be withheld, under a non-disclosure application. There are rules about this which will need to be followed, including strict timeframes for making a request (eight weeks ahead of an oral hearing) and specific reasons for when information can be withheld, which are set out in the Parole Board Rules 2019. The final decision lies with the Parole Board.
